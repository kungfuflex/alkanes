## Current Status

The Alkanes TypeScript library is in active development with a focus on stability, debugging, and documentation. The core functionality is implemented and working, but there are still areas that need improvement and expansion.

### Development Status
- **Version**: 0.1.0 (Alpha)
- **Stability**: Alpha - API may change
- **Coverage**: Core functionality implemented
- **Documentation**: Basic documentation available
- **Testing**: Basic integration tests in place

### Recent Milestones
1. Implemented core RPC functionality
2. Set up Docker-based development environment
3. Implemented Protocol Buffer integration
4. Created basic integration tests
5. Implemented wallet management utilities
6. Enhanced debugging for RPC functions



## Known Issues

The following issues have been identified:

### 1. API Consistency
- Some API methods have inconsistent naming conventions
- Parameter validation is not consistent across all methods
- Error messages could be more descriptive and actionable

### 2. Documentation Gaps
- Limited API reference documentation
- Few examples outside of integration tests
- Missing architecture documentation
- Limited explanation of ALKANES metaprotocol concepts
- Insufficient documentation of cross-implementation compatibility

### 3. Testing Coverage
- Limited unit test coverage
- Integration tests cover only basic scenarios
- No performance tests
- Limited edge case testing
- No cross-implementation compatibility tests

### 4. Error Handling
- Error handling could be more robust
- Some error conditions may not be properly handled
- Error propagation could be improved
- Limited error recovery strategies

### Table Relationship Understanding
- **Different Tables for Different Functions**:
  - `protorunes_by_address` uses the `OUTPOINTS_FOR_ADDRESS` table
  - These tables are populated through different paths
  - `RUNE_ID_TO_OUTPOINTS` is only populated for runestone transactions or when edicts are processed
  - `OUTPOINTS_FOR_ADDRESS` is populated for all transactions with valid addresses
  - This can lead to inconsistent behavior between functions

- **Testing Implications**:
  - Double indexing in tests can cause inconsistent state
  - Need to use `clear()` between tests
  - May need to manually populate tables for testing
  - Need to verify token IDs and balances before making assertions

- **Potential Solutions**:
  - Enhance the `save_balances` function to populate both tables
  - Add a post-processing step to ensure table consistency
  - Create a new function that populates both tables consistently

### Metashrew Integration Challenges
- **Append-Only Database Design**:
  - Metashrew uses an append-only database design
  - This design enables historical queries and chain reorganization handling
  - But it also leads to larger database size and potential performance issues

- **Stability Issues**:
  - Running the view layer separately from the indexer can cause stability problems
  - Metashrew recommends using rockshrew-mono for production deployments
  - This may limit deployment flexibility

- **WASM Runtime Constraints**:
  - WebAssembly has memory and performance constraints
  - Complex operations may hit these constraints
  - Fuel metering prevents infinite loops but adds overhead
